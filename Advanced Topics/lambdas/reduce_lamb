'''The reduce() function in Python takes in a function and a list as an argument.
 The function is called with a lambda function and an iterable and a new reduced result is returned. 
 This performs a repetitive operation over the pairs of the iterable. 
The reduce() function belongs to the  functools module. '''

#  Python code to illustrate
# reduce() with lambda()
# to get sum of a list
 
from functools import reduce
li = [5, 8, 10, 20, 50, 100]
sum = reduce((lambda x, y: x + y), li)
print(sum) # 193
